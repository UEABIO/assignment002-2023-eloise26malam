# Summative 2 - BIO 5023Y

## Exploring the influence of nutrition on the duration of singing in *Gryllodes sigillatus,* the decorated cricket - does diet quality affect mate signalling?

# ðŸŽ¶ðŸ¦—

This report looks at the relationships between nutrition, mass, and the length of sexual signalling songs in the decorated cricket.

**Main findings:**

-   The more nutritional the cricket's diet, the more weight they gain - For each 12% increase in nutrition, a cricket will gain an additional 0.005 grams.

-   The more nutritional the cricket's diet, the longer they sing - Each 12% increase in nutrition increases song duration by 0.37 seconds.

**General Conclusion:**

-   Crickets with a more nutritional diet will gain more weight and also have more energy to expend on performing the costly calling song.
-   The longer a cricket's song, the more likely it is to attract a female, so diet quality subsequently has an influence on reproductive ability
