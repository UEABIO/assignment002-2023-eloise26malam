## **Exploring the influence of nutrition on the duration of singing in *Gryllodes sigillatus,* the decorated cricket - does diet quality affect sexual signalling?**

### **By Eloise Malam**

**ABSTRACT:** The male decorated cricket uses a calling song to attract females. This study looks at the influence of nutrition and weight on the length of this sexual signalling displayed by individuals. It was found that crickets with a higher percentage of nutrition in their diets had both a greater weight increase and a greater song duration. This implies that nutrition is an important factor in a cricket's reproductive ability, possibly because the individuals with a better diet have more resources to allocate towards sexual signalling.

### [**Introduction**]{.underline}

*Gryllodes sigillatus* is a species of cricket known by many names including decorated, banded, and tropical house cricket. The signalling song produced by males is facilitated by the orthopteran insect's forewings and antennae and works via the principles of sexual signalling to attract a female mate [@subramaniam1990]. In fact, the song produced can be so alluring to the female that, if other crickets' songs can be heard nearby, a male cricket will increasingly engage in mate guarding behaviours; actions such as isolating the mated female in a burrow wok to ensure paternity by preventing the female from mating multiple times [@bateman1999]. Not only does a male's song work to attract females and dissuade possible rival males, but female *Gryllodes sigillatus* crickets exposed to the acoustic displays of their species reach their full mass quicker than females exposed to either heterospecific songs from different species or no songs at all [@bateman2005]. This would mean that the females are able to reach sexual maturity quicker when in the presence of viable mates. Due to the importance that sexual signalling has on a cricket's ability to reproduce, this paper aims to look at factors that can influence singing ability, more specifically, the affects of nutrition on male individuals.

The data-set used contains information collected over the course of a week pertaining to male crickets' nutrition, song duration, weight change, and size. I hypothesize that males with a more nutritious diet will have a greater increase in weight. As a result of this, I also predict that individuals will sing for a greater duration if their diet has a greater nutritional percentage, as more resources can be allocated to the costly signalling act.

### [**Analysis**]{.underline}

This report was produced using R version 4.2.3 [@R] The following packages were used during the data analysis and visualisation process: tidyverse [@tidyverse], colorBlindness [@colorBlindness], rstatix [@rstatix], performance [@performance], MASS [@MASS], broom [@broom] and patchwork [@patchwork].

When investigating the minimum and maximum data points, a negative value for song duration became apparent. Believing this to be a typing error, I used the absolute values for song duration so as to avoid any impossible values. Only this variable was altered in such a way, as negative values are valid for other variables such as weight change.

For some exploration and visualizations, the data was sorted into groups of Low (≤36%), Medium(=48%), and High(≥60%) nutrition diets. This allowed for better comparisons between the upper and lower groups as a whole by simplifying the number of dietary categories.

I used an ordinary least squares linear model to analyse song duration, looking at diet and weight change as possible explanatory variables. Interaction terms were removed as they were shown not to have an impact: The terms set out relationships between weight change and diet (ANOVA *F*~1,533~ =1.7576, *P=* 0.1855) as well as weight change and size (ANOVA *F*~1,533~ =5.3477, *P=* 0.0211). A further term was removed, as the variable describing size was seen to be unnecessary (ANOVA *F*~1,535~ =2.3698, *P=* 0.1243). The data remained in its original form in the model, as a log transformation was found to make a worse-fitting model.

### [**Results & Discussion**]{.underline}

##### **DIET AND WEIGHT CHANGE**

I hypothesized that the greater the nutritional percentage of a cricket's diet, the more weight it would gain over the course of the observational period (1 week). To test this, I compared the weight gain of crickets in the groups of Low, Medium, and High nutrition using the linear model described previously.

**Fig.1 - LEFT**: The nutritional percentage of a crickets diet (12-84%) compared to its change in weight over the observational period of one week (n=539). The region highlighted in red represent a loss of weight while the green region conversely represents weight gain. The median, interquartile range, and range for each nutritional percentage are respectively illustrated by the middle line, box, and whiskers on their plot. Outliers are represented by circular plots. **RIGHT:** The mean weight change in grams is presented to 3 significant figures for each nutritional category - Low (≤36%), Medium(=48%), and High(≥60%). Error bars extend one standard deviation above and below the mean.

##### **DIET AND SONG DURATION**

Based on the results above which illustrated a greater weight gain in crickets with a better diet, I further hypothesized that the group with higher nutrition would also have a greater song duration due to an increased amount of resources to allocate to the costly action.

This is consistent with previous knowledge, as acoustic production in crickets is a highly energetic process, which would require an abundance of resources derived from diet.

**Fig. 2 - LEFT:** The nutritional percentage of a crickets diet compared to the total length of time (in seconds) spent singing over the observational period of 1 week. The background colours surrounding the boxes show the nutritional category of the diet; red representing Low, orange for Medium, and green for High. The median, interquartile range, and range for each nutritional percentage are respectively illustrated by the middle line, box, and whiskers on their plot. Outliers are shown as circular filled plots. **RIGHT:** The mean song duration in seconds is presented to 4 significant figures for each nutritional category - Low (≤36%), Medium(=48%), and High(≥60%). Error bars extend one standard deviation above and below the mean.

This is significant as a male cricket's ability to sing for a greater duration than their peers has a great impact on their fitness, something which is facilitated by their nutrition. A longer song would suggest a greater chance of mating through the principles of sexual selection.

Males of a species competing against each other for the opportunity to mate with a female is a common occurrence in nature [@cox1977]. These competitions can manifest as direct antagonism where males get into a physical conflict. Such is the case with red deer, as growing larger antlers to fight with correlates to a greater level of reproductive success [@kruuk2002]. The other way that males can outshine their peers is through courtship displays which are aimed to impress the females, as is true of the singing behaviour found in *Gryllodes sigillatus*. Another well-known example of this includes male birds such as peacocks sporting a large ornamental plumage. In the wild, this colourful addition could be seen as a counter-intuitive for survival, making it more difficult to hide from and escape predators [@burk1982]. The same could be said for the cricket - producing a loud acoustic for an extended time could alert predators to the individual's location. However, this is exactly why it is so attractive to females of the species - If an individual can survive despite their handicap they must be of good fitness, a quality that females will want to pass on to their offspring [@andersson1986].

The colour of each point corresponds to the percentage of nutrition in the cricket's diet from 12-84%, on a scale where red=low and green=high.
